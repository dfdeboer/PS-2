Problem Set #2, EGR 304 Spring 2023

Below are some git commands, more than one for each student in EGR 304.
Add your name just below one of the commands listed below.
Write some documentation for that command on a few lines underneath 
your name. By way of example, Prof. dDB has done this for the "add"
command.  Do your work in the same style.    

Save the file, add it, commit it, and push it back up to professor De Boer's repository.
If your push is rejected, use "git pull origin <filename>" to merge the work of 
others into your file and then add (stage), commit, and push the file again. 

Commands to briefly document
----------------------------
add
Douglas De Boer
The command, "git add <filespec>" converts the targeted file(s) from 
tracked-modified status or from untracked status to tracked-staged status.  
The files are now ready for a commit (snapshot), presuming they are not 
further edited before the commit.
