Problem Set #2, EGR 304 Spring 2023

Below are some git commands, more than one for each student in EGR 304.
Add your name just below one of the commands listed below.
Write some documentation for that command on a few lines underneath 
your name. By way of example, Prof. dDB has done this for the "add"
command.  Do your work in the same style.    

Save the file, add it, commit it, and push it back up to professor De Boer's repository.
If your push is rejected, use "git pull origin <filename>" to merge the work of 
others into your file and then add (stage), commit, and push the file again. 

Commands to briefly document
----------------------------
add
Douglas De Boer
The command, "git add <filespec>" converts the targeted file(s) from 
tracked-modified status or from untracked status to tracked-staged status.  
The files are now ready for a commit (snapshot), presuming they are not 
further edited before the commit.  

branch


checkout


clone


commit
<<<<<<< HEAD
Chris Dyk 
The command, "git commit" creates a new commit of the contents of the
index created by the "git add" command and adds a message describing the changes. The branch is usually 
updated to point to the new commit.
=======
Logan Van Itallie
The command, "git commit" takes the current staged files and saves them as the latest version on the tree. This also prompts for a comment on the edits made, to ease searching in the future.
